                            Preamble

 The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works.

 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
 the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
 software for all its users. This License, the GNU General Public License,
 applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any
 other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software
 Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License
 instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
